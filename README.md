# Compound-Interest-Conceptualizer

This is a re-upload of a project, since I did not use Github at the time. This project spanned October 2020. 

This project revolves around the thought experiment of trying to conceptualize a large amount of capital when combined with compound growth. One way to conceptualize such vast amounts of capital is to model a fund which disimburses towards future decendants of the fund creator, creating income for future decendants as a form of universal basic income. 

This calculator allows for various input parameters such as initial capital amount, capital growth rate, inflation rate, as well as various parameters used to model the lifespan, payment cycle, and reproduction rate of various decendants. This calculator simulates the population growth and portfolio magnitude over time.
